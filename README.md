Group assignment for financial programming toghether with Carlos Montenegro and SÃ©bastien Pavot (Both IESEG collegues). 

Using Python we had to create a datamart consisting of data stored in multiple tables. 
First the datatables needed some cleaning, afterwards they needed to be merged in order to link useful information from different tables
as well as allowing us to create several meaningfull variables. 
This assignment also included visualizations in Tableau.
